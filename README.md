# PopMovies-and
Pop Movies shows the popular and top rated Hollywood movies. You can read movie reviews its plot and also view trailers on YouTube. This app uses theMovieDb API to get the list of movies from web and also uses many popular libraries such as Picasso, Retrofit etc.. This my end lesson project exercise in Android Developer Nanodegree by Google from Udacity which I got as a part of Google India Challenge Scholarship 2018.
Also available on Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=arunkbabu90.popmovies

#How to use
 * First, You need to obtain an API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/
 * Then, define the API key as a Gradle Global property under MovieDbApiKey="YourAPIKey" for security purposes
    OR you can directly define it in the project but it's perfectly unsafe and is not encouraged
 * After that the project will compile properly
